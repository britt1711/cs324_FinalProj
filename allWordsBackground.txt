It
is
2023
and
times
are
tough
in
Turtle
Pond.
The
UT
Austin
Facility
has
been
slacking
on
feeding
the
turtles
that
reside
here.
Everyone
is
starving,
and
you
heard
that
having
money
is
the
only
way
to
make
things
happen
in
America.

Students
passing
by
have
talked
about
all
these
coins
that
they've
lost,
and
you
want
to
find
them
to
feed
your
family
and
friends
at
Turtle
Pond.
You've
never
left
the
water
because
of
the
bugs
flying
around
outside,
but
times
are
desperate
now
and
you
know
that
venturing
out
to
find
these
coins
is
your
only
option.

Your
goal
is
to
bring
back
the
most
amount
of
coins
to
help
feed
yourself
and
your
family.

Do
you
think
you
can
do
it?
Are
you
up
to
the
challenge?
