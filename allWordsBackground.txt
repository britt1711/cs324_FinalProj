It
is
2300
and
times
are
tough
in
America.
Everyone
is
starving.
No
one
has
money
...
no
one
except
the
presidential
family,
of
course.
They
live
a
lavish
life,
having
renovated
the
White
House
to
be
ten
stories
tall!
You
are
a
part
of
a
rebel
group
that
has
decided
to
infiltrate
the
White
House.
The
plan
is
to
go
through
every
floor
of
the
building
and
steal
valuables
to
sell
on
the
black
market
for
lots
and
lots
of
cash.
You
know
with
each
floor
up,
there
are
more
and
more
valuable
items.
But
beware!
The
White
House
is
heavily
guarded,
and
you
have
been
told
that
the
higher
you
get
in
floor,
the
more
guards
there
will
be
and
the
faster
they
will
move,
so
you
have
to
make
sure
your
reflexes
are
top
of
the
line.
After
you
have
been
spotted
by
these
guards
5
times,
you
will
have
to
make
a
run
out
of
there
as
the
White
House
will
go
into
a
lockdown
and
you
do
not
want
to
be
trapped
inside.

Your
goal
is
to
bring
back
the
most
amount
of
valuables
to
help
feed
yourself
and
the
rebel
group
while
not
getting
caught.

Do
you
think
you
can
do
it?
Are
you
up
to
the
challenge?
